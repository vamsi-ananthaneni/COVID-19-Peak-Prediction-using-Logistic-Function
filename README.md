# COVID-19-Peak-Prediction-using-Logistic-Function


This repository contains the code and resources for the project on COVID-19 peak prediction using the logistic function. The project aims to estimate the total number of COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths worldwide by implementing a live dashboard for COVID-19 spread analysis.

## Introduction
The Corona Virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious and transmitted virus that was first discovered in Wuhan City, China in December 2019. In this project, our main objective is to leverage technology to estimate the total number of COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths globally. We have developed a Python-based live dashboard that provides insightful visualizations for analyzing the spread of COVID-19. The dashboard utilizes popular libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

## Methods
The project utilizes various Python libraries and techniques, including:

- **NumPy**: NumPy is a powerful library for scientific computing and handling arrays and matrices efficiently. It provides essential functionality for data manipulation and numerical operations.

- **SciPy**: SciPy is a scientific computing library that builds on NumPy. It offers a wide range of mathematical algorithms and functions for optimization, interpolation, integration, and more.

- **Pandas**: Pandas is a versatile data analysis library. It provides data structures such as data frames for efficient data manipulation and analysis. Pandas enables tasks like data cleaning, aggregation, filtering, and correlation analysis.

- **Random**: The Random module in Python is a built-in module that allows generating random numbers and performing random actions. It will be used to introduce randomness in our analysis, such as shuffling elements or selecting random samples.

- **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a powerful data visualization library in Python. It provides a wide variety of plots and charts, enabling us to create clear and informative visualizations to understand the spread of COVID-19.

To estimate the COVID-19 peaks, we employ non-linear regression using the logistic function. The logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function, is graphically adapted to the data and provides a curve suitable for modeling growth or decay. The formula used for the logistic function is: `Y = 1 / (1 + exp(B1(X - B2)))`. Additionally, data cleaning and database normalization techniques are applied for efficient analysis.

## Results
Based on the provided datasets, we have merged the data into a Python tool, specifically Jupyter Notebook. By importing the required libraries and adding the files, we were able to visualize the data and fit the logistic function to predict the COVID-19 peaks. The results are showcased in the form of graphical representations, providing insights into the spread of COVID-19.
